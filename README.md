# Smart News Aggregator API

In the digital age, the volume of news articles produced every day is staggering.
Readers are increasingly overwhelmed by the amount of available content and often struggle to find reliable
and relevant information that matches their personal interests.
To address this challenge, I propose the development of a **Smart News Aggregator Reader Personalization Platform**.

This platform collects news articles from multiple external APIs, stores and processes them using NoSQL databases (MongoDB and Redis),
and delivers a personalized reading experience to users.
It incorporates intelligent recommendation features, secure user authentication via JWT tokens, and real-time analytics to improve user engagement.
